# PROJECT CONVERSION RATES (Supervised Machine Learning) - Jedha Fullstack
## Company's Description ðŸ“‡
www.datascienceweekly.org is a famous newsletter curated by independent data scientists. Anyone can register his/her e-mail address on this website to receive weekly news about data science and its applications !

## Project ðŸš§
The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

## Goals ðŸŽ¯
The project can be cut into four steps :

Part 1 : make an EDA and the preprocessings and train a baseline model with the file data_train.csv
Part 2 : improve your model's f1-score on your test set (you can try feature engineering, feature selection, regularization, non-linear models, hyperparameter optimization by grid search, etc...)
Part 3 : Take some time to analyze your best model's parameters. Are there any lever for action that would help to improve the newsletter's conversion rate ? What recommendations would you make to the team ?
Deliverable ðŸ“¬

## To complete this project, your team should:
- Create some relevant figures for EDA
- Train at least one model that predicts the conversions and evaluate its performances (f1, confusion matrices)
- Analyze your best model's parameters and try to make some recommendations to improve the conversion rate in the future
